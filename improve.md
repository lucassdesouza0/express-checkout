# To Improve

[Readme](https://github.com/lucassdesouza0/express-checkout/#readme) - [Folder Structure](https://github.com/lucassdesouza0/express-checkout/blob/master/structure.md) - [Was Done](https://github.com/lucassdesouza0/express-checkout/blob/master/done.md)

### UI

    Due to time and configuration issues, I was unable to set storybook to provide the UI components in the application.
    This would be one of the next improvements that I would make to the control of the application interface.

    Another point I would like to revisit would be the division of the components within the atomic design pattern, making a better study and separating them in the best way.

### State and Side Effects

    I was unable to complete the configuration of Redux together with Saga to manage the state and side effects of the application due to the SSR mechanism, it would be an improvement that I would make for the better separation of the business rule on the front end.

### Theming

    t would be interesting to have a theme for application, controlling the visual differences by encapsulating some css properties for a better control of the final result

### Test Coverage

    I tried to create the most critical and also the most diversified tests to better present my knowledge. But a next improvement would be to seek more complete testing coverage.
