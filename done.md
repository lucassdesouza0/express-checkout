### Typescript

- In order to guarantee consistency in all the project I used Typescript ;

### Pages

- I created 3 pages following the steps of the challenge;
- The SSR feature was used to load the translation provider and fetch the api data;

### Data

- to provide products data I used the nextjs api routes feature to create a fake api;
- I used the SWR library to fetch and revalidate data from the api;

### State

- I applied the strategy of using the React Context API to control the state of the application;

### Dev Experience

- I used ESLint, Prettier and StyleLint to make shure that I'm following the best code practices;

### i18n

- I created an i18n provider for the application to make shure that the user is receiving the localized information;

### UI

- Despite being simple, I tried to create reusable UI Components following the Atomic Design pattern;

### Tests

- I used Jest with Testing Library to run all the unit tests;
