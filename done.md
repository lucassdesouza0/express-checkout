### Pages

- I created 3 pages following the steps of the challenge;
- I used the SSR feature to load the translation provider and fetch the api data;

### Data

- I used the nextjs api routes feature to create an fake api to provide products data;
- I used the swr library to fetch and revalidate data from the api;

### State

- I applied the strategy of using the React Context API to control the state of the application;

### Dev Experience

- I use ESLint, Prettier and StyleLint to make shure that i am following the best code practices;
- I use Typescript in all the project to guarantee consistency;

### i18n

- I created an i18n provider for the application, to make shure that the user is receiving the localized information;

### UI

- Despite being simple, I tried to create reusable UI Components following the atomic design pattern;

### Tests

- I use Jest with Testing Library to run all the unit tests;
